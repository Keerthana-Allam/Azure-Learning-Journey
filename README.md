## Day 1 - [01/23/2024] 🚀
## Explore core data concepts   
Options for representing and storing data, and about typical data workloads.   

### 1. Identify common data formats
- We can classify data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.   
  #### A. Structured Data 🏢
        Fixed Schema, Mostly Tabular data.
  #### B. Semi-Structured Data 🌐
        Information that has some structure, with some variation allowed, Eg: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
  #### C. Unstructured Data 📄
        Not all data is structured or even semi-structured. Eg: documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files.

- There are two broad categories of data store in common use:    
  File stores   
  Databases

### 2. Explore file storage    
Local file systems: Hard disk of personal computer, and on removable media such as USB drives.    
Centralized File storage: Shared, Hosted in the cloud, cost-effective, secure, reliable, can store large volumes of data.   

- File Format Considerations:    
  - Type of data: Structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.    
  - Applications and services: Requirements for reading, writing, and processing.    
  - Human readability: Importance of readability.    
  - Optimization: Considerations for storage and processing efficiency.

- Common File Formats:    
  - **Delimited Text Files 📊:**
       **Format:** Plain text with field delimiters and row terminators.    
      **Common Types:**   
          CSV (Comma-Separated Values)    
          TSV (Tab-Separated Values)    
          Space-Delimited    
          Fixed-Width Data    
      **Structure:** Fields separated by commas, rows terminated by carriage return/new line.
  -   **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 📜:**
       Definition: Hierarchical document schema.       
       Entities: Data entities (objects) with multiple attributes.      
       Flexibility: Suitable for structured and semi-structured data.
       Objects are enclosed in braces ({..}) and collections are enclosed in square brackets ([..]).

## Day 2 - [01/24/2024] 🚀
  -   **Extensible Markup Language (XML) 📝:**    
        Type: Human-readable data format.Superseded by: JSON (less verbose).    
        Usage: Still used in some systems for data representation.    
  -  **Binary Large Object (BLOB) 📁:**    
       Definition: Files stored as raw binary data.    
       All files are ultimately stored as binary data (1's and 0's).    
       Unlike human-readable formats, bytes of binary data are not mapped to printable characters.    
       Common for unstructured data types that require interpretation by applications.    
  -  **Optimized file formats 🚀:**    
       Specialized for compression, indexing, efficient storage, and processing.   
       **Common Formats:**           
        **Avro: 📦**     
       
          Type: Row-based format.   
          Header: Describes data structure stored in JSON.   
          Storage: Binary information.   
          Use Cases: Efficient compression, minimized storage, and network bandwidth.   
        **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar Format) 📊:**   
        
          Organization: Columns rather than rows.   
          Development: HortonWorks for Apache Hive.   
          Structure: Stripes of data with column-wise organization.   
          Footer: Holds statistical information for each column.   
        **Parquet: 🏞️**
      
          Type: Columnar data format.   
          Development: Cloudera and Twitter.   
          Organization: Row groups with column-wise storage.   
          Efficiency: Specializes in storing and processing nested data types efficiently.   
          Features: Supports efficient compression and encoding schemes.

Day 3 - [01/27/2024]
Explore databases
Database: a dedicated system for managing data records rather than files.
1. Relational Database:
   - used to store and query structured data 
   - The tables are managed and queried using Structured Query Language (SQL)
2. Non-relational databases:
   - don’t apply a relational schema to the data
   - NoSQL database, even though some support a variant of the SQL language.
   - four common types of Non-relational database commonly in use.
     1. Key-value databases in which each record consists of a unique key and an associated value
     2. Document databases, which are a specific form of key-value database in which the value is a JSON document (which the system is optimized to parse and query)
     3.
